the request function R(t) represents the total amount of computation that has been requested up to time t.
the deliverd computation function R'(t) represents the total amount of computation that has been delivered up to time t.
The capacity function C(t) represents the maximum amount of computation that could be delivered up to time(if the processor runs under full load).load).
The remaining capacity function C'(t) represents the total amount of computation that has not been used up to time.
